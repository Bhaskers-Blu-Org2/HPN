# Understand: Accelerations and Offloads

Processing of received packets can be done in software by the host CPUs or offloaded to the NIC and passed directly into memory. The path a packet traverses prior to reaching its ultimate destination (application) is known as its datapath. Accelerations and Offloads can be divided by their native, synthetic, or hardware datapaths.

The chosen datapath is per network adapter and flow. A single host can leverage all three datapaths simultaneously while a single adapter can leverage different datapaths per data flow. For example, a host may have three NICs, each passing network traffic through a different data path. Alternatively, a host could have a single NIC that uses different datapaths for different traffic types or applications; the options and ultimate choice depends on your goals and scenarios.

The performance, flexibility, configuration complexity, and security of each datapath can be summarized as follows:

## Data Paths

This section describes the different data paths that network traffic can take on a Windows host and the different categories of accelerations and offloads.

### Native Datapath

#### Description
The native datapath describes packets received on any adapter that does not have direct access to the hardware (NIC) and is not attached to a virtual switch. This is the default datapath after Windows is installed.

The picture below shows data travelling on the native datapath; coming off the wire, entering the physical port of the physical adapter, then through the miniport driver and ultimately operating system.

#### When you would use this Datapath

Any adapter that is not attached to a Hyper-V Virtual Switch, not using RDMA, or other Direct Memory Access technology such as SR-IOV.

#### Benefits

  - Easy to configure (default configuration for Windows)

  - No overhead from the Hyper-V virtual Switch

  - Medium performance

#### Drawbacks

  - No virtualization scenarios

  - Packet processing consumes Host CPU cycles

#### Scenarios

Default out of the box Windows networking. Non-Virtualized Scenarios that do not use RDMA or SR-IOV to pass data directly into memory. Common examples include:

  - Web Front-End Servers (Baremetal)

  - Remote Desktop Services â€“ Session based virtualization

  - Systems that demand lower latency over the availability, maintenance, and consolidation benefits of virtualized infrastructure

### Synthetic Datapath

#### Description
The synthetic datapath describes packets received on any adapter that is bound to a virtual switch.  This is the default datapath for adapters attached to the Hyper-V Virtual Switch.  This includes virtual NICs (vNIC) in the host OS as well as virtual machine NICs (vmNIC) in guest virtual machines and containers.

The picture below shows data travelling on the synthetic datapath; coming off the wire, entering the physical port of the physical adapter, then through the miniport driver.  Next it travels through the virtual switch before riding along the VMBus and ultimately reaching a vNIC or vmNIC.
